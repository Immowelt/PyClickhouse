class Cursor(object):
    """
    Due to special design of Clickhouse, this Cursor object has a little different set of methods compared to
    typical Python database drivers.

    You can try to use it with normal pattern, like calling "execute" method first and then calling "fetchall"
    or "fetchone" afterwards. This pattern is fragile and not recommended, because the Cursor has to handle
    selects and other operations differently.

    Preferred usage pattern: call
        "select" for selects,
        "bulkinsert" for inserting many rows at once,
        "ddl" for any other statemets that don't deliver result,
        "insert" for inserting a single row (not recommended by Clickhouse)

    When calling "select", you can only use FORMAT TabSeparatedWithNamesAndTypes in your query, or omit it, in
    which case it will be added to the query automatically.

    After calling "select", you can call "fetchone" or "fetchall" to retrieve results, which will come in form
    of dictionaries.

    You can pass parameters to the queries, by marking their places in the query using %s, for example
    cursor.select('SELECT count() FROM table WHERE field=%s', 123)
